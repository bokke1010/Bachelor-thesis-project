This project is the python code for my bachelor's thesis mathematics & computer science

How to run:
Find a source of images and a test image, all of the same resolution.
This PRNU comparison is not scale or translation invariant, so cropping different parts of the image does not result in functional results.
Set the large window size global variable in main.py to a even value that divides both the horizontal and vertical resolution, somewhere between 120 and 400 is adviced.
Estimate the standard deviation of the white (Gaussian) noise component of these images and enter it.
